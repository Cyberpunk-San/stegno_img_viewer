# stegno_img_viewer
Project Name: SecureView â€“ Encrypted Image Messenger

Description:

SecureView is a steganography-based image viewer app built with Kivy and Python. It allows users to securely hide messages inside images using encryption and retrieve them with a one-time key. The app functions as a normal image viewer and camera but includes a secret trigger mechanism for encoding and decoding hidden messages.

Key Features:

âœ… Image Viewer & Camera â€“ View images and capture photos seamlessly.
âœ… Steganography-Based Encryption â€“ Hide secret messages inside images.
âœ… Trigger Mechanism for Message Input â€“ Pressing a specific button (e.g., volume button) opens a textbox for entering a hidden message.
âœ… One-Time Key Generation â€“ Encrypts the message and provides a unique key for secure retrieval.
âœ… Secure Decryption â€“ The recipient presses the trigger button and enters the one-time key to reveal the message.
âœ… User-Friendly Kivy UI â€“ Smooth, responsive, and cross-platform interface.

Tech Stack:

Framework: Kivy (Python)
